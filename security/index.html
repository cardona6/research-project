        <h2>HTTPS</h2>

        <hr>
        <h3>What is HTTPS?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>HTTPS is a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network which is widely used on the Internet.
            HTTPS consists of communication over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) within a connection encrypted by Transport
            Layer Security, or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer. The main motivation for HTTPS is authentication of
            the visited website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data.</p>

        <h3>why is HTTPS Important?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> HTTPS helps prevent intruders from interfering with communications between your websites and users' browsers. By
            intruders, we mean attackers with malicious intentions and legitimate, but meddlesome companies, such as ISPs
            or hotels that feature page ads. Intruders exploit unprotected communications to trick users into providing confidential
            information or installing malicious software, or to place their own ads on your resources. For example, some
            third parties insert ads on websites that potentially have the ability to spoil the user experience and create
            security vulnerabilities. Intruders exploit all the unprotected resources that circulate between your websites
            and users. Images, cookies, scripts, HTML ... all can be exploited. Intrusions can occur anywhere on the network.
        </p>

        <h3>How Does HTTPS Work?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>HTTPS pages typically use one of two secure protocols to encrypt communications - SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS
            (Transport Layer Security). Both the TLS and SSL protocols use what is known as an 'asymmetric' Public Key Infrastructure
            (PKI) system. An asymmetric system uses two 'keys' to encrypt communications, a 'public' key and a 'private'.

        <h2> XSS </h2>
        <h3>What is a XSS ?</h3>
        <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.</p>
          
        <h3>How the malicious JavaScript is injected
</h3>The only way for the attacker to run his malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser is to inject it into one of the pages that the victim downloads from the website. This can happen if the website directly includes user input in its pages, because the attacker can then insert a string that will be treated as code by the victim's browser.

In the example below, a simple server-side script is used to display the latest comment on a website:print "<html>"
print "Latest comment:"
print database.latestComment
print "</html>"
              <h3>A typical example of how XSS works</h3>
               <p> 1-  The attacker injects a payload in the website’s database by submitting a vulnerable form with some malicious JavaScript
<br>2-The victim requests <br>3-the web page from the website
The website serves <br>4-the victim’s browser the page with the attacker’s payload as part of the HTML body.
The victim’s browser will execute the malicious script inside the HTML body. In this case it would send the victim’s cookie to the attacker’s server. The attacker now simply needs to extract the victim’s cookie when the HTTP request arrives to the server, after which the attacker can use the victim’s stolen cookie for impersonation.
